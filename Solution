- Inverted index for all dictionary words (Too slow for large dataset)
- Load all file data in memory
- Make sure to get ready to take queries fast enough by asynchronously processing the content
- Optionally just handle all queries at the master server to cut down latency. Will not work under concurrent load
- Improvements
  - Non-blocking hashmap ?
  - Use a suffix tree
  - Introduce more parallelism when dealing with requests ( need to profile where the time is going in lookup vs request processing)
